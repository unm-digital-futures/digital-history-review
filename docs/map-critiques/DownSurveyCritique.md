# The Down Survey of Ireland Critique
##### By Audriana McManus  

Ireland is known for having a rough history, whether it be from occupation, war, or famine. Put all three together, and you have the description for Ireland during the 1600s. [The Down Survey of Ireland](http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/index.html) is a GIS project by Trinity College Dublin that collects, digitizes, and overlays all the maps created during the Down Survey (1655-1658). The project was funded by the Irish Research Council under its Research Fellowship Scheme and began on October 1st, 2011 and was completed on March 31st, 2013.  

### What is the Down Survey?

According to the website, the Down Survey was "...the first systematic mapping of a large area on such a scale attempted anywhere. The primary purpose of these maps was to record the boundaries of each townland and to calculate their areas with great precision." These maps were mostly made by former soldiers and included details such as roads, rivers, churches, castles, and fortifications. The website includes all four types of maps that were made during this time that include: Country, County, Barony, and Parish. It is pointed out that some maps are missing from the record due to the lands having un-forfeited parishes as well as a large amount of the maps being lost in an accidental fire in 1711. The website also states that the records they have are only **copies** of the original maps because all the original documents were destroyed in the Custom House Fire in 1922.
 
### Website Usability

The first thing I should have done when looking at this website was look at the "user guide" tab on the top of the page. I did not though and spent the first few minutes floundering around trying to understand what the website was trying to tell me. Needless to say, the website has a relatively non-intuitive design. However, after reading the user guide, everything became much more user friendly. Within the user guide it uses titles that show that the program is designed for those that live in Ireland such as "I want to see the 17th Century map of my Parish." 

There are multiple interfaces that can be used. The main one is that Down Survey compilation. In this interface you can choose to search through Parish, Barony, and County. You can go from big picture to more focused. However, as mentioned before, some maps are missing.

Before continuing it should be noted that most these interfaces can be switched from four different map overlays. The first is the Google Terrain map. Then there is Satellite mode, the 1670 Down Survey overlay, and the 1890 Ordinance Survey. This is really interesting to see using the data from the 1641 Depositions. In this map, it is a visual representations of the recorded murders in Ireland.

The 1641 Depositions interface has the most data within the map, though there are no ways to narrow the search except zooming in. Once zoomed in, you can click on the red dots and a pin type popup will appear giving the user information on that specific site. The information is very organized in categories on the popup. However, the information is not always clear and there is no links in the popup to further look into the information.

The thrid map interface that can be looked at is the Land Ownership by Religion. It can be switched from the 1641 survey data to the 1670 survey data but the map cannot be changed like the Depositions map can. You can zoom the map in through the sidebar by choosing the Province and County.

The last map interface that can be looked at is the Landowner by Name. On this page, the user can type in a name and search what land they owned in 1641 and then if they owned the land in 1670. After entering the name, a dot will aappear on the map and it can be zoomed in on until the boundaries of their land is defined. After clicking on the dot, it will open a pin type popup on the map that gives the information on the owner in 1640 and then the owner in 1670 as well as their religion and other information the creators though important. The user can click on the land next to the one they are looking at, and it will bring up another popup with information from that land.

### Conclusion

Though there is definitely some trial and error, this GIS Project is rather neat to explore. I would presonally recommend this for researchers looking to see the changes that happened from the 1640 survey and the 1670 survey in a more big picture way. However, it could definitely be used by a casual user. It could work on the way information is found, such as how some maps do not have a full search bar. Another idea that the website could use is a combination of all the maps together; the Land Ownership tries to do this, but does not contain all the information. The about page does state that the creators have received so many requests to improve the website, they have turned off that specific way to contact them. Other than that, this is a really interesting site to spend a few hours digging through.
